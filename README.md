# M13 Classification Challenge
This repository contains a classification challenge comparing the accuracy of Logistic Regression against Random Forest.
# Code Source
Starter code was provided by the instructor. I used VSC's Copilot to resolve errors in my code.
# Conclusions
Both models produced high accuracy training and test scores. Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression. I believe this is due to Random Forest's capability to make accurate associations among multiple variables whereas Logistic Regression treats variables as having linear relationships.
